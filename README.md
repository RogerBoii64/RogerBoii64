## **Hello everyone, I first want you all to know that I don't know what I'm doing and have no idea where I'm going with this, so please don't have any high expectations of me. Anyways, here's my intro:**

- 👋 Hi, I’m @RogerBoii64 , I'm just a guy in his early twenties who lives in the Netherlands and is on the autistic spectrum (I was diagnosed with Asperger's in childhood before the definitions and everything changed) who likes the philosophy behind open-source software and who's just trying to build himself an independent adult life that doesn't suck.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Wasting time on YouTube and Reddit, with a bit of electronic music production and some light Arch Linux testing in a virtual machine on the side, I guess. (Currently an absolute noob to both).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Nothing coding/developing related right now (and I likely never will, lol). I guess I can put here that I'm trying to learn a bit of electronic music production and that I'm learning things about the GNU/Linux world in general, although I'm honestly too lazy to dive deeper into advanced territory, at least for now.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Obviously, since I don't know how to properly use this site yet (let alone how to program/develop anything), it's physically impossible for me to even consider such a thing.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't. (Unless you don't mind randomly hitting up some guy who's intelligence is probably too low to keep up with yours (and anything programming/developing related, since I simply never learned any of it). And in case you're wondering, I don't know what my IQ is and I'm too afraid to find out by taking any test, because after having thought about it for a while, I strongly suspect it to be somewhere below average, even though being worked up about something you simply can't change (with current technology, at least) is wasted energy which would be much better spent on growing and learning as a person, but I digress.)

- 🤨 Hey @RogerBoii64, if you don't code/develop anything (and don't even know how to use this site properly), then what do you mean to accomplish with your presence on GitHub? ... Nothing of particular significance. If anything, I will probably only ever use this account to share very simple things like low-effort dotfiles (in the sense that they're only minimally edited, mostly due to me not really having the knowledge to do edit them very extensively, although my laziness also plays a role in this) of Linux desktop rices I pester my Arch VM with once in a while. Only time will tell if I'll ever do something else on this account.

**So yeah, there's that. If you for some reason read this all the way through, thank you, and I wish you a fantastic day, as well as a great time continuing to develop/discuss/whatever else you all do on here together. :)**
